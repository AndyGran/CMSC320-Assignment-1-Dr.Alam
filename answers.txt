Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science could be applied to business sales. If a company has data for each of their sales opportunities, we can
use that data to predict which sales opportunities will win or lose. What can be done is someone can feature engineer related data
(such as amount, creation stage, opportunity type) and then they can use that data to create a prediction model. This model can
then let businesses know which type of opportunities they should focus on so that they could maximize their sales.
