Q1: Why might we consider using git?

Answer: For our purposes, we can use git to externally manage our code.
Instead of having to submit large files of code our manually updating a project
we can just push and pull to and from git, simplifying our process. It's also
good to practice in class so that we are familiar with using git in the real
world where git is often used to manage code version history and for a
synchronized workflow.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science could be applied to business sales. If a company has data for each of their sales opportunities, we can
use that data to predict which sales opportunities will win or lose. What can be done is someone can feature engineer related data
(such as amount, creation stage, opportunity type) and then they can use that data to create a prediction model. This model can
then let businesses know which type of opportunities they should focus on so that they could maximize their sales.
