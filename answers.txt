Q1: Why might we consider using git?

Answer: For our purposes, we can use git to externally manage our code.
Instead of having to submit large files of code our manually updating a project
we can just push and pull to and from git, simplifying our process. It's also
good to practice in class so that we are familiar with using git in the real
world where git is often used to manage code version history and for a
synchronized workflow.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science could be applied to business sales. If a company has data for each of their sales opportunities, we can
use that data to predict which sales opportunities will win or lose. What can be done is someone can feature engineer related data
(such as amount, creation stage, opportunity type) and then they can use that data to create a prediction model. This model can
then let businesses know which type of opportunities they should focus on so that they could maximize their sales.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: When you merge you combine the changes from one branch into another. This creates a new commit which combines 
both branches histories. On the other hand, when you rebase you reapply commits from one branch onto another. 
This doesn’t make a new commit, it just amends/changes the history of the branch which you are reapplying to.
Merge basically perserves the history of each branch while rebasing changes the linear history of whichever branch 
you’re reapplying to.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I'm hoping to improve my skills when it comes to applying learned math and statistics to computer science.
Oftentimes I find it tough to visualize how data interacts with each other, but I'm hoping that through this course
I can learn how to approach and handle the data to draw meaningful conclusions.
