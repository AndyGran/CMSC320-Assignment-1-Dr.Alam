Q1: Why might we consider using git?

Answer: For our purposes, we can use git to externally manage our code.
Instead of having to submit large files of code our manually updating a project
we can just push and pull to and from git, simplifying our process. It's also
good to practice in class so that we are familiar with using git in the real
world where git is often used to manage code version history and for a
synchronized workflow.
